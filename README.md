This repository contains a Home Assistant integration for the [Kingspan Watchman SENSiT sensors](https://www.kingspan.com/gb/en-gb/products/tank-monitoring-systems/remote-tank-monitoring/sensit-smart-wifi-tank-level-monitoring-kit) to read levels from an oil tank. The integration relies upon a connection to Kingspan's cloud service.

## Â Installation

Right now, the integration must be installed as a custom repository from HACS. Follow the instructions for adding custom repositories [in the HACS documentation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) then download the repository to your Home Assistant instance and add the integration to your instance. The repository to use is:

<https://github.com/masaccio/ha-kingspan-watchman-sensit>

You will be asked for your Kingspan username and password which will then be cached by Home Assistant for all future updates.

## Entities

The integration reads data from the SENSiT sensor every 8 hours. The tank data is updated every 24 hours but 8 hours is chosen as the update point. Usage data and forcasts of empty are different from the Kingspan app. Rather than using just the previous day's reading, this integration uses the pasy 14 days as the basis for a prediction of empty, and the current usage is also the average of the past 14 days.
