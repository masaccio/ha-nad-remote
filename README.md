# NAD Amplier remote control for Home Assistant

This repository contains a Home Assistant integration NAD Amplifiers. Much of this is a fork of the core integration and this work may be merged back into core in the future depending upon how it develops. Goals for this custom integration are:

* Implemented
    * auto-discovery of telnet-capable NAD amplifiers
    * zone 2 selection
    * volume controls for all speakers
* Not yet functional:
    * switches for DSP programs

## Â Installation

Right now, the integration must be installed as a custom repository from HACS. Follow the instructions for adding custom repositories [in the HACS documentation](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) then download the repository to your Home Assistant instance and add the integration to your instance. The repository to use is:
